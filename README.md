# visualchemeng-js

## This repository 
JavaScript, HTML and CSS code for the simulation modules of the [Visual Chemical Engineering Project](http://visualchemeng.com).

## About the VCE project 
The vce project aims to deliver chemical engineering principles in a way that sticks. We place you in control of common unit operations with dynamic, graphics-driven feedback, all within the comfort of your browser. No installation required ðŸš€. Under the bonnet, vce is powered by years of chemical engineering knowledge, brought to you through the power of [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), [Plotly](https://plot.ly/) and more.

## ðŸ”¨ðŸ”§Contributing 
We welcome contributions big and small. If you'd like to contribute or help with a simulation module, please get in touch at [amcguire227@gmail.com](mailto:amcguire227@gmail.com). If you think you've found a bug please check the exisiting [Issues](https://github.com/issues) first and add a new Issue if its not there already. We accept [Pull Requests](https://github.com/pulls)!

## Usage  
Just clone or download this repository and open any of the html files in [`/apps/*/html/test/`] in your browser (note: it's easiest to navigate to a given test directory in your file explorer and double-click the file you want to run). That's it! All dependencies are bundled with the repository or auto-downloaded. The latest stable version of each module can be found on 
[visualchemeng.com](http://visualchemeng.com). 

## Credit where credit due 
The VCE modules rely on a number of third-party libraries to create the user interface, render objects to the canvas and simulate the particle physics, letting us get on with the chemical engineering side of things! These include:
* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - Lauren McCarthy
* [matter.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js) - Liam Brummitt 
* [screenfull.js](https://github.com/liabru/matter-js) - Sindre Sorhus
* [plotly.js](https://plot.ly/) - Plotly
